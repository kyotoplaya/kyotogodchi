About plugins:

1. display-password-kyoto: A [CrackHouse](https://github.com/V0r-T3x/pwnagotchi_LCD_colorized_darkmode/blob/b5792224f1c17b6f14e2acac1e28470cdd424983/files/crack_house.py)-inspired plugin that is adapted for waveshare_v3 and v4. It works in conjunction with the wpa-sec. Displays the nearest hacked wifi and its password (if the access point is in range) or the last hacked access point.

2. [ups_plugin_1_3](https://github.com/PhreakBoutique/UPSLite_Plugin_1_3/blob/main/upslite_plugin_1_3.py): Slightly modified original plugin. Support for displaying the charging or not status (+ - sign) has been removed, as Chinese boards do not support this function. The % sign has been added.

3. [memtemp-plus](https://github.com/crahan/pwnagotchi-plugins/blob/main/memtemp-plus.py) and [exp](https://github.com/GaelicThunder/Experience-Plugin-Pwnagotchi/blob/master/exp.py): The display coordinates have been changed, and the text has been slightly replaced (example: Exp on XP).

The rest of the plugins are in their original form.
